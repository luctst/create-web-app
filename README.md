## Why using this project ?
This project was created to easily start a web application with all the tools that you need check the list below, it's simple.

But why not using create-react-app package ? Well this package is really good for starting a new project with react and his environment i'm also using it some times for work, but personally i think that you do not control everything with create-react-app that's why i created this project with a simple structure ready to go whenever you want with a simple command.

Now let's see how this project was thinking :smiley:
